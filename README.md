# Ship with AI

Companion site and live demo repository for **AI Genius — Season 5, Episode 3: "Ship with AI:
Review, Secure, and Deploy with Confidence."**

The repository demonstrates this lifecycle:

```text
Issue → Copilot drafts a PR → Copilot Code Review → Agent Merge →
GitHub Actions security gate → Dependabot remediation → GitHub Pages
```

Its security theme is **OWASP Top 10:2025 A03 — Software Supply Chain Failures**. The recordable
start state intentionally contains an outdated dependency, an inactive workflow with unsafe
defaults, and an optional fake secret-scanning fixture. The core demonstration does not require
Generic patterns, because that setting is not available to every presenter. Presenters still show
where Secret Protection and Push protection are configured.

The versioned release contract is stored in [`demo-kit.json`](./demo-kit.json). Maintainers publish
new template versions using [`MAINTAINER-RELEASE.md`](./MAINTAINER-RELEASE.md).

## Choose your path

| I want to… | Start here |
|---|---|
| Follow the session | [`AUDIENCE-WALKTHROUGH.md`](./AUDIENCE-WALKTHROUGH.md) |
| Set up and rehearse the full demonstration | [`MANUAL-DEMO-GUIDE.md`](./MANUAL-DEMO-GUIDE.md) |
| Present or record after rehearsing | [`PRESENTER-RUNSHEET.md`](./PRESENTER-RUNSHEET.md) |
| Understand the security lesson | [`src/pages/secure-supply-chain.astro`](./src/pages/secure-supply-chain.astro) |
| Explore the implementation | [`src/pages/pipeline.astro`](./src/pages/pipeline.astro) |

`RUNSHEET.md` remains as a compatibility pointer to the two role-specific guides.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24, as specified by `.nvmrc`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anothergeorgecoldham/ship-with-ai.git
cd ship-with-ai
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The start state contains deliberate training findings. Local execution is suitable for learning;
do not deploy it as a production application. `npm run build` creates the static site in `dist/`.

## Preparing a demonstration repository

Create a disposable repository from the released template. Preview bootstrap changes:

```bash
npm run demo:bootstrap -- --repo <owner>/<repository>
```

Apply them only after confirming the target:

```bash
npm run demo:bootstrap -- --repo <owner>/<repository> --apply
```

Bootstrap enables auto-merge and creates an active default-branch ruleset requiring the `build`
and `audit` checks from GitHub Actions, with zero required human approvals. It also prevents
default-branch deletion and force pushes, with no bypass actors. Template settings and rulesets
are not assumed to carry over.

The `audit` check runs on every PR to `main`. It permits only the intended vulnerable start state
while `marked` remains at its seeded version; Dependabot updates and PRs after remediation must
pass the clean-state policy. Production deployment always requires the clean state.

Auto-merge must still be enabled per non-draft PR; it does not opt in every PR automatically.
If checks have already passed, immediate merge is normal. See
[branch rules and auto-merge setup](./MANUAL-DEMO-GUIDE.md#branch-rules-and-auto-merge)
for manual verification and recovery.

Before recording, manually confirm the Copilot coding agent and Agent Merge are available, then
run:

```bash
npm run demo:preflight -- --repo <owner>/<repository> --confirm-copilot
```

Do not start until the final line is `READY TO RECORD`. The canonical source repository is
protected from bootstrap writes unless `--allow-canonical` is supplied explicitly.
